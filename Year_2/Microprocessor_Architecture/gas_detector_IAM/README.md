During the course of Microprocessor Architecture, I created a gas sensor that can be easily implemented in any household.
Connected to a Arduino microcontroller board, the data gathered by the sensor is constantly read and processed.
Features:
- the gas level in the room is displayed on a 16x2 LCD display;
- a buzzer would start ringing if the detected gas level is considered unsafe
