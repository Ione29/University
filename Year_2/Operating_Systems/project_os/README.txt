For the server we created a Django project that runs on localhost, port 8000, and loads the page which includes the game. 
The Django project contains 2 apps: project_os, which is the main framework and redirects to the other app, dinoApp, which contains the game itself.
The game is made in JavaScript. It features a highscore system.
The controls are:
-SPACE/UP for jump (hold for a higher jump);
-DOWN mid-air to go down or on ground to duck under obstacles;
