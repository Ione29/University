# Future Directions for Wi-Fi 8 and Beyond

## Summary

### Abstraction
- Wi-Fi 7 already in development, with Wi-Fi 8 out in 2027, 2028

### Introduction
- Wi-Fi is operating in unlicensed frequenct bands, designed with an open ecosystem in mind
- Wi-Fi speeds:
  - Wi-Fi 1, 1997: 1 Mb/s
  - Wi-Fi 6, today: 10 Gb/s
  - Today, laptops support data rates in excess of 2 Gb/s
- Wi-Fi played & is still playing a major role in connecting people to the internet (63% of mobile traffic)
- Wi-Fi 7 is being developed with the following in mind:
  - wireless AR / VR
  - Industrial IoT (IIoT)
  - network evolution toward edge computing
  - AI
  - virtualization
- improving the performance of Wi-Fi is not as easy in the past, since we can't just double the bandwidth anymore
  - Wi-Fi is moving from the paradigm of a signel connection over a single channel towards collaborative multi-link operation, which is supposed to give applications greater capacity & lower latency
  - one clear need: reduce data delivery latency & jitter for AR, VR & IIoT

### Wi-Fi Generations
- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) was originally standardized in 1997 & branded as *Wi-Fi*
- Wi-Fi was extensively modified in 1999 & 2003 in order to support the 2.4GHz band, used in industrual, scientific & medical (ISM) band
- 2003: Intel releases it's first mobile PC platform, *Centrino*
  - at that time it was thought that wireless internet was a critical feature in the "unwiring of the PC"
- 2019: Wi-Fi Alliance creates the Wi-Fi generation branding instead of using the IEEE standards & introduces Wi-Fi 6 
  - Wi-Fi 4: the baseline, first Wi-Fi to support both 2.4 / 5 GHz bands + error correction via low density parity check codes + MIMO (multiple in, multiple out) communication
  - Wi-Fi 5: introduced in 2013, it at least doubled the data rate via larger channel sizes
- QoS improved significantly as well from generation to generation
  - devices support priotizied channel access with IEEE 802.11e 
  - capacity upgrades via larger numbers of spatial streams, wider channels & frame aggregation

### Wi-Fi 6 & Wi-Fi 6E
- introduced in 2019, based on IEEE 802update.11ax standard amendmend
- while previous Wi-Fi generations relied on each device independently contending for channel access, Wi-Fi 6 introduced a trigger-based operation mode where an AP (access point) can trigger multiple stations to transmit data concurrently
- this was needed in order to enable the introduction of uplink multi-user operation
- other notable features:
  - new symbol format that increased symbol time and reduced OFDM carrier spacing  by 4x
  - Downlink (DL) & Uplink (UL) orthogonal frequency division multiple access, which enables multi-user operation on both DL and UL
  - individual target wake time (TWT), which lets STAs negotiate availability times with the AP in order to improve power consumption
  - dedicated certification profile for devices supporting only 20 MHz channels, better suited for the IoT market segment, where device cost & long battery life are more important than raw performance
- these numerous features that Wi-Fi 6 got resulted in further reduced latency & QoS improvement, escpecially in spaces that have their spectrum congested & 
- a limiting factor of WI-Fi achieving gigabit data rates in dense environments is the limited amount of unlicensed spectrum space
  - most countries have the 2.4 GHz aband only 78MHz to 84MHz widem allowing use of up to three / four **nonoverlapping** 20 Mhz channels + this band is also used a lot by bluetooth & other unlicensed wireless devices
- the 5GHz band only has about 480MHz of unlicensed spectrum, and even that is constrained in most countries for indoor operations
- 2018: FCC proposes allocation of 1.2GHz of spectru in the 6GHz band to unlicensed operation, which more than tripled the amount of spectrum available for Wi-Fi
- 2021: Wi-Fi 6E introduces the new 6GHz band 

### Wi-Fi 7
- supposed to be available in early 2024
- main features:
  - MLO: multi-link operation
    - the main feature of Wi-Fi 7, allows devices to beneft
  - support for 320 MHz wide channels
  - 4096-QAM modulation scheme
- Wi-Fi 7 is aiming to enchance QoS even further and deliver low latency
