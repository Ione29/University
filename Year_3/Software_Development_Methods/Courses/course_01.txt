Chapter 1: software engineering

There are 4 engineering fields:

Software engineering < Hardware engineering < Data engineering < Systems Engineering

for software development, you need a methodology
    methodology = a body of practices, procedures and rules
    is implemented as a set of well-defined steps or phases, each of which ends with a clear, measurable set of exit cirteria

    methodology key characteristics:
        process-oriented
        adaptive / flexible
        collaborative
        documentable & documentation - driven
        manage complexity
        reduces risk & uncertainty
        enchances consistency & quality
        focus on quality

    a methodology consists of two components:
        a standard process
        a standard notation

    methodology elements:
        phases: each phase has specific goals and deliverables
        activities: in each phase, specific activities are defined, detailing tasks, tools, and techniques
        roles & responsibilities: each team member hass a defined tole in order to ensure clear ownership & communication
        artifacts: deliverables and documentation produced throughout the process (ex: documents, design models, test cases, etc.)

    there is no standard methodology for any project developemnt process, but there is one concept in common: the process is iterative

classical software methodologies:
    structured methodology
    information engineering methodology
    object-oriented methodology

choosing a methodology for the project:
    there are several factors that influence the decision, including:
        project siez
        complexity
        requirements stability
        budget
        team size and expirience
        desired level of flexibility

    the ideal methodology depends on several factors:
        project complexitty
        team expirience

Chapter 2: Introduction to Systems Engineering

Systems engineering = an interdisciplinary field of engineering focusing on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed over their life cycles
    in systems engineering, a system is more than just a collection of parts; the concentration is on the analysis and design of the whole thing, not focusing on individual components / parts.
    systems engineering points towards analysis and synthesis models for problems that affect multiple aspects of the real world
    it integrates all disciplines and specialty groups

    characteristics:
        plans, designs and develops complex systems
        integrates various engineering disciplines, to create a unified system
        manages the entire system lifecycle, from concept to retirement, to ensure performance, cost-effectiveness, and safety
        considers the system in its broader context, including its impact on environment & society

    focuses on:
        syustem as a whole
        life cycle management
        stakeholders
        optimization in organizations

system = an assembly of components, interoperating between themselves
