ALL PROJECTS ARE SOLO!

-----------Mandatory Project - NN-----------------

Pick up a data set, and make a project about it:
    create a presentation
    write report

-----------Bonus Projects - DSP-------------------

You Choose one of the following:
    Easy: flash
        available grades: 7, 8, 9, 10
        -5 for failure
        grade multiplier: 0.1

    Medium: delta, sigma
        available grades: 8, 9, 10
        -3 for failure
        grade multiplier: 0.2

    Hard: a/d pipelined
        available grades: 9, 10
        -2.3 for failure
        grade multiplier: 0.3

The grade you get on the project * the grade multiplier = how much you get for the final grade
    Ex: you choose the pipeline as a project and you get 9, the bonus for the final grade is 9 * 0.3 = 2.7p extra (out of 10)

---------------------Lab Tests---------------------
DSP:
    10 minutes
    2 students at a timedeci
    design 1 filter
    if failure rate <50%, he will do something in week 14, no guarantee

NN:
    Matlab -> change an existing assignment
    translating from Python to Matlab
    around weeks 9-11
    still withing a time limit, not provided

--------------------Scheduling---------------------
Monday:
    DSP Lab (if SDM Course IS Wednesday)

Wednesday:
    DSP + NN Courses
    DSP Lab (if SDM course IS NOT on Wednesday)

Friday:
    NN Lab

The labs are weekly, not biweekly: 2 hours/week for NN, 2 hours/week for DSP
The DSP Project hour is supposed to be considered as a lab

--------------------Miscellaneous------------------
Bring your own computer:
    must have python (preferably Anaconda)
    "compiled" alternatives are allowed: pycharm, google collabs, etc.
    if we are good enough we get to do Matlab, so make sure you have it installed just in case

Regarding cheating:
    something copy pasted form the net == cheating => failure
