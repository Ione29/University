Hierarchy (least complex to most complex): AI -> ML -> NN -> DL
 AI = Artificial Intelligence
 ML = Machine learning
ANN = Artificial Neural Network
 NN = Neural Network
 DL = Deep Learning

ML -> builds mathematical model that can adapt using the inputs
ANN / NN -> set of structures and algorithms inspired from biological brains and designed to recognize patters

Connectionist approach:
-individual neurons in a NN are interconnected through synapses
-the connections allow the neurons to signal each other when information is processed
-each connection has a weight
-connection weight = 0 if there is no connection between 2 neurons
-the connection weight shows the importance of the input comming from that connection

Perceptrons:
-for the neuron / perceptron having inputs Xi and targets Ti, you can perform learning computing for all the inputs the real output, finding the error and make the update

dW = ex
n = vector(W) * vector(X)
y =
e = T - y

-NN jobs are supervized (with examples)
-unsupervised learning -> clustering
